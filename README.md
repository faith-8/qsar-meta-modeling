**Enhancing QSAR Predictive Power and Explainability: Meta-Modeling and SHAP Feature Importance Analysis for Drug Discovery**

## Overview

This research explores methods to improve Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling for predicting drug bioactivity. By integrating multiple molecular fingerprints and leveraging Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature importance analysis, the study demonstrates how meta-modeling enhances both predictive accuracy and model explainability.

The repository also includes a Streamlit-based web application for predicting pIC50 values and visualizing feature importance. The Web application is currently deployed on the HuggingFace website. The link is provided below.

## Key Features
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluation of molecular fingerprints for predictive performance.
- **Meta-Modeling**: Combining multiple fingerprints to improve QSAR predictions.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Understanding the contribution of fingerprints to predictions.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Interactive tool for prediction and feature visualization.
